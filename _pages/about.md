I am gamedev student living in Poland,  specializing in Unity and Unreal Engine as gameplay programmer. Making fun interactive experiences is why I like doing it. I am disabled person but that doesnt stop me from doing that.

I  also participite  in  gamejams, I like them because they help me with my creativity and  I can always see what other cool games people made.
